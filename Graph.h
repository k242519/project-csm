    GRAPH CLASS SUMMARY:


    PURPOSE OF THE GRAPH CLASS:
    This class represents a city map as a weighted graph
    The idea is that Each location is a node, and each road is an edge with a weight
    (usually representing distance in kilometers)

    A FEW IMPORTANT COMPONENTS:

    - numLocations:
          Stores how many total locations the graph should have
          (It is used for display or validation)

    - locations:
          A map which basically stores each Location object
          Key   = location ID
          Value = Location object

    - adjList:
          Adjacency list to store graph edges
          Key   = source location ID
          Value = vector of edge objects representing all roads
                  going out of that location

    - Edge struct:
          Represents a road from one location to another
          destination = an ID of the connected location
          weight      = distance between the two locations

    FUNCTIONS:
    Constructors:
        - Graph():
            Creates an empty graph.

        - Graph(numLocations):
            Creates a graph that expects a certain number of locations.

    Location Management:
        - addLocation(id, name, isHospital):
            Adds a new location to the graph

    Edge Management:
        - addEdge(src, dest, weight):
            Creates a one way connection from src to dest

        - addBidirectionalEdge(loc1, loc2, weight):
            Creates a two way road between loc1 and loc2

    Retrieval:
        - getLocation(id):
            It returns a pointer to the location with that ID
            Useful for accessing data of nodes

        - getNumLocations():
            Returns the total number of locations in the graph

        - getAdjList():
            Returns a reference to the adjacency list

        - getHospitalIds():
            Returns a list of all location IDs that are hospitals

    Display:
        - displayGraph():
            Prints the full city map:
                All locations
                All roads and distances
